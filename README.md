# Metaheuristic Visualizations

Implementations and visualizations for selected metaheuristic optimization algorithms

## Ant Colony Optimization

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a probabilistic technique inspired by the behavior of ants searching for food. It is used to find optimal paths through graphs.

## Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithms (GA) are search heuristics that mimic the process of natural selection. They are used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization and search problems.

## Harmony Search

Harmony Search (HS) is a music-inspired algorithm that mimics the improvisation process of musicians. It is used for optimization problems.

## Simulated Annealing

Simulated Annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy.

## Particle Swarm Optimization

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively improving a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It is inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling.

## Tabu Search

Tabu Search is an iterative optimization algorithm that uses a local search method and a tabu list to avoid cycles and improve the search for the global optimum.
